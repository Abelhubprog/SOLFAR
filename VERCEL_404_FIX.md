# 🚨 Vercel 404 Error Resolution Guide

## Problem Analysis
Your Vercel deployment is showing a 404 error despite building successfully. The logs show it's deploying an old commit (`a010353`) instead of the latest fixes.

## ✅ Immediate Solutions

### 1. Force Vercel to Use Latest Commit
Go to your Vercel dashboard and:
1. **Redeploy from Dashboard**:
   - Go to your project dashboard
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Redeploy" on the latest commit
   - OR click "Visit" next to commit `deaa5b3` (latest)

### 2. Manual Deployment Trigger
If the above doesn't work:
1. Go to Project Settings > Git
2. Make sure the branch is set to `main`
3. Check that "Auto-deploy" is enabled
4. Trigger a new deployment manually

### 3. Clear Vercel Cache
Sometimes Vercel caches old configurations:
1. Go to Project Settings > Functions
2. Scroll to "Cache" section
3. Click "Clear Cache"
4. Redeploy

## 🔧 Configuration Fixes Applied

### Updated `vercel.json`:
```json
{
  "buildCommand": "pnpm build",
  "outputDirectory": "dist", 
  "installCommand": "pnpm install",
  "framework": "vite",
  "functions": {
    "api/**/*.js": {
      "runtime": "nodejs18.x"
    }
  },
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/((?!api).*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Added `.vercelignore`:
- Excludes unnecessary files from deployment
- Ensures clean builds

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After redeployment, test these URLs (replace `your-domain` with your actual Vercel domain):

1. **Main App**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/`
2. **Health Check**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health`  
3. **Token Info**: `https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/token-info`

## 📋 Expected Results

✅ **Main App**: Should load the SOLFAR interface with wallet connect buttons
✅ **API Health**: Should return `{"status":"ok","message":"SOLFAR API is running on Vercel"}`
✅ **Token Info**: Should return SOLFAR token details

## 🚨 If Still Getting 404

### Option 1: Delete and Recreate Project
1. Go to Project Settings > General
2. Scroll to "Delete Project"
3. Recreate from GitHub: `Abelhubprog/SOLFAR`

### Option 2: Check Domain Settings
1. Go to Project Settings > Domains
2. Ensure your domain is properly configured
3. Check for any redirect rules

### Option 3: Environment Variables
Make sure these are set in Project Settings > Environment Variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
```

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Try redeployment first** - This should resolve the 404
2. **Check the commit being deployed** - Should be `deaa5b3` or newer
3. **Test all endpoints** once live
4. **Report back** with the actual Vercel domain for further debugging if needed

The latest commit `deaa5b3` contains all the necessary fixes and should deploy without the 404 error! 🚀
